GridWorld Game
========
A simple zombie survival game built in Java using the GridWorld API.


Proposed Plan (May change in final release)
======== 
*The Objective of the game is to find certain items in order to escape/win.

__THE PLAYER__

* Starts with bare minimal items (weapon&bandages) and will spawn in a random area in the world.

* Will have certain things to keep notice of: Health, experience, hunger, inventory, ammo,etc.

* Each level up will increase max health and damage reduction until max level is achieved.

__MONSTERS/ZOMBIES__

* Travels randomly in the world; if it's in close proximity(Certain amount of blocks) to the player,
it will chase the player and try to attack him.

* When slain, it will "drop" an item that will benefit the player (Bandages/food/ammo/etc).
The player will also gain experience when the monster is slain.
